# Ticket 6: Final Integration and Build Process

**Task:** Integrate all migrated modules and set up the Rust build and release process.

**Description:** This ticket covers the final stage of the migration, which involves integrating all the migrated Rust modules, ensuring they work together seamlessly, and setting up a robust build and release process for the new Rust application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All migrated modules (CLI, HTTP server, file watcher, etc.) are integrated into a single, cohesive Rust application.
- The application compiles and runs without errors.
- The application's functionality is verified to be equivalent to the original TypeScript application.
- A CI/CD pipeline is established for building, testing, and releasing the Rust application.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Module Integration:**
    -   Create a main application module (`main.rs` or `lib.rs`) that brings together all the migrated components.
    -   Ensure that data flows correctly between the different modules (e.g., the CLI invokes the correct application logic, the HTTP server interacts with the core services, etc.).
    -   Refactor the code as needed to ensure a clean and idiomatic Rust architecture.

2.  **Build Process:**
    -   Configure the `Cargo.toml` file for release builds, including optimization settings.
    -   Set up cross-compilation to build binaries for different target platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows). The `cross` crate can be used for this.

3.  **Release Process:**
    -   Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build, test, and release process.
    -   The workflow should be triggered on new tags or releases.
    -   The workflow should build the binaries for all target platforms, run the tests, and create a new release on GitHub with the compiled binaries as artifacts.

**Suggested Tools:**
- `cargo`
- `cross` (for cross-compilation)
- `GitHub Actions`

**Unit Tests:**

At this stage, the focus will be on integration tests that cover the interaction between different modules.

```rust
// in tests/integration.rs

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_cli_integration() {
        // This is a placeholder for a real integration test.
        // You would typically run the compiled binary with different arguments
        // and assert that the application behaves as expected.
        assert!(true);
    }
}
```
